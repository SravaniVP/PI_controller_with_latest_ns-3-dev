# PI controller with latest ns-3-dev

## Upgarding THe APIs of the old version to match the latest version of ns-3 

Proportional Integral (PI) controller is a popular AQM algorithm that forms the basis of
PIE and PI^2 algorithms. A model for PI in ns-3 was developed in 2016, but hasn’t been
updated to work on the latest ns-3-dev. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in merging
PI in the main line of ns-3. This project aims to upgrade the PI implementation in ns-3 so that
it can be sent for review to ns-3 developers.
